the king and the queen ruled the quiet castle by the river.
a man and a woman walked to the market near the castle at dawn.
the prince rode a horse across the grassy field beside the river.
villagers sold warm bread and sweet apples in the busy market.
at night the queen and the prince listened to music while the king spoke with a wise man.
